# SDA Pitch Valorization & Storage - Interactive Feasibility Study

## 📋 Overview

This project presents an interactive web application that explores the feasibility of utilizing Solvent Deasphalted (SDA) pitch as a valuable feedstock for asphalt production. The application transforms a comprehensive technical report into an engaging, interactive digital experience.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Primary Objective**: Assess the viability of converting SDA pitch into marketable asphalt products
- **Secondary Objective**: Increase coker capacity by diverting surplus vacuum residue
- **Engineering Focus**: Design considerations for large-scale heated storage tanks (>600 m³) operating at 150-200°C
